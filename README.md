# LTC_3D_image_classification
Repository for a research work based on using liquid neural network for 3D medical image classification task \n
Research & realisaton CNN-RNN net to 3D image classification. 
Scored over MedMNIST and Brats Dataset (same experiment as in this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330710656_CNN-LSTM_Cascaded_Framework_For_Brain_Tumour_Classification)
Link train/test data I used from Brats Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1izZ4veOERG6tTqGC85lfFP1jawgNjui5?usp=drive_link
